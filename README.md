# Dynamic layout

This module provides dynamic grids that place elements in accordance to their predefined layouts.

### Available Grids
**Compact grid** - displays elements of equal width in the most efficient way possible,
based on their height.

**More coming soon**

## Installation
```
$ npm install dynamic-layout
```

## Usage
Just mark every grid with a `grid` class and every element with `grid-element`.

To activate all grids on the page, import and run `initGrids()` after DOM is ready. 
 See specific grids for further details.


## Compact grid

* Preserves element order
* Automatically readjusts element placement on resize
* Allows for simple grid nesting - displaying grids inside of grids
* Provides ways to specify horizontal/vertical spacing between the elements and more...
